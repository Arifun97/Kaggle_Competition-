# Kaggle_Competition-

This is a kaggle competition I participated in my INST 490 (Data Science) class. This was a text classification task. Training and test data was provided and my task was to classify each document from a data file containing a movie review from IMDB into one of the two categories: 1 if the review is positive and 0 if its negative.
Based on the accuracy of our prediction we were placed in a leaderboard. I completed the task using SVM and logistic regression classifier. I got a accuracy of 0.89040.
